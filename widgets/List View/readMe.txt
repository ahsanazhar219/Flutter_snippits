In Flutter, both SliverList and SliverList.builder are used to create scrollable lists within a CustomScrollView.
 Letâ€™s explore the differences between them:

SliverList:
A SliverList is a predefined widget that represents a list of fixed-size children (usually widgets)
 in a scrollable area.
You provide the list of children directly when creating a SliverList.
Itâ€™s suitable for cases where you have a small number of children that can fit comfortably in memory.
Example usage:
Dart

SliverList(
  delegate: SliverChildListDelegate(
    [
      // List of fixed-size children
      Text('Item 1'),
      Text('Item 2'),
      // ...
    ],
  ),
)

SliverList.builder:
A SliverList.builder is a more efficient way to create a list of children dynamically.
It lazily builds only the visible children as they scroll into view, which is memory-efficient for large lists.
You provide a builder function that generates the children on-demand based on their indices.
Itâ€™s suitable for cases where you have a large number of children or when the children are generated dynamically
(e.g., from a data source).
Example usage:
Dart

SliverList(
  delegate: SliverChildBuilderDelegate(
    (BuildContext context, int index) {
      // Build the child at the specified index
      return Text('Item $index');
    },
    childCount: 100, // Total number of items
  ),
)

In summary:

Use SliverList when you have a fixed list of children.
Use SliverList.builder when you need to generate children dynamically or have a large number of items.
